	<p>I'm Igor Zavalyshyn. I'm a post-doc at
		<a href="https://uclouvain.be/">UCLouvain</a> university in Louvain-la-Neuve,
		Belgium (not to be confused with UCL in London nor KU Leuven in, well, Leuven).
		I have a PhD degree in Distributed Computing from
		<a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico</a>
		in Portugal and <a href="https://uclouvain.be/">UCLouvain</a> in Belgium. </p>

	<p>During my PhD under the supervision of my supervisors
		<a href="http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~nsantos/">Nuno Santos</a>
		and <a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/ramin.sadre/">Ramin Sadre</a> I
		worked on privacy issues of IoT, specifically within the smart home
		environment, and built private-by-design IoT systems that span across local
		home, cloud and mobile environments. The code of all of these systems is
	open and publicly available at my
	<a href="https://github.com/zavalyshyn">Github</a> page.
	You can find a full list of my publications at the following <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/225/5718.html">DBLP page</a>.</p>

	<p>I read, surf and do bouldering whenever I have free time. </p>
